title: 2022 APFS Advent Challenge Day 18 - Decryption
---

Now that we know how to parse the [File System Tree](/post/2022/12/15/APFS-FSTrees), [Analyze Keybags](/post/2022/12/21/APFS-Keybags), and [Unwrap Decryption Keys](/post/2022/12/22/APFS-Wrapped-Keys), it's time to put it all together and learn how to decrypt file system metadata and file data on encrypted volumes in APFS.

## Tweaks

All encryption in APFS is based on the [XTS-AES-128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption_theory#XEX-based_tweaked-codebook_mode_with_ciphertext_stealing_(XTS)) cipher, which uses a 256-bit key and a 64-bit ["tweak"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher#Tweakable_block_ciphers) value.  This _tweak_ value is position dependent.  It allows the same _plaintext_ to be encrypted and stored in different locations on disk and have drastically different _ciphertext_ while using the same AES key.  Every 512 bytes of encrypted data uses a tweak based on the container offset of the block's initial storage.  

Knowledge of the AES key alone is not always enough for successful decryption.  If the encrypted block is ever relocated on disk, the data is not guaranteed to be re-encrypted with a new tweak.  In these cases, the tweak can not be inferred based on the block's on-disk location, so we must learn the original tweak value used for encryption.  

## Identifing Encrypted Blocks

There are primarily two sets of data protected with the APFS _Volume Encryption Key_: [_File System Tree Nodes_](/post/2022/12/15/APFS-FSTrees) and [_File Extents_](post/2022/12/19/APFS-Data-Streams).  As we've discussed, _File System Tree Nodes_ store the _File System Records_ that contain the file system's metadata, and _File Extents_ contain the bulk of the data stored in a file's _Data Streams_.

### Encrypted FS-Tree Nodes

A volume's _Object Map_ is never encrypted, but its referenced _virtual objects_ may be, as is the case with FS-Tree Node on encrypted volumes.

Let's revisit the value half of an _Object Map entry_.

```cpp
typedef struct omap_val {
  uint32_t ov_flags; // 0x00
  uint32_t ov_size;  // 0x04
  paddr_t ov_paddr;  // 0x08
} omap_val_t;        // 0x10
```

If the `ov_flags` bit-field member has the `OMAP_VAL_ENCRYPTED` flag set, then the virtual object located at `ov_paddr` is encrypted. These objects are never related without being re-encrypted, so the tweak of the first 512 bytes of data can be determined by the physical location of the data using the following logic, with the following tweak values incremented for each subsequent 512 bytes of data:

```cpp
uint64_t tweak0 = (ov_paddr * block_size) / 512;
```

### Encrypted Extents

Extent data can be relocated on disk and is not guaranteed to be re-encrypted.  Due to this, the initial tweak value is stored in the `crypto_id` field of the `j_file_extent_val_t` file system record:

```cpp
typedef struct j_file_extent_val {
  uint64_t len_and_flags;  // 0x00
  uint64_t phys_block_num; // 0x08
  uint64_t crypto_id;      // 0x10
} j_file_extent_val_t;     // 0x18
```

## Conclusion

We've now discussed all of the information needed to access data on software-encrypted APFS volumes.  This decryption requires the knowledge of the password of any user on the system or one of the various recovery keys.  While APFS hardware encryption works in largely the same manner, the encryption also depends on keys that are stored within the specific security chip on a given system.  There are currently no known methods of extracting these chip-specific keys; therefore, the data on hardware-encrypted devices must be decrypted at acquisition time on the device itself.  The only software that I am aware of that is capable of this is [Cellebriteâ€™s Digital Collector](https://cellebrite.com/en/digital-collector/).

_Full disclosure:  I currently work for Cellebrite and helped develop these capabilities.  I do not directly profit from the sales of Digital Collector but felt it appropriate to disclose my association when linking to a commercial product.  I am not trying to sell you anything.  Unfortunately, I am also not at liberty to discuss the methodology used to facilitate this decryption._

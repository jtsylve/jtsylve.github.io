title: 2022 APFS Advent Challenge Day 9 - Volume Superblock Objects
---

In this blog post, we will explore the _Volume Superblock_ in APFS, a critical data structure containing important information about an individual APFS volume. We will discuss locating the Volume Superblock on disk and describe some fields in the on-disk format. By the end of this post, you should better understand the volume Superblock’s role in the APFS file system and how to parse its on-disk structure.

## Locating Volume Superblocks

Every volume in APFS has a _Volume Superblock Object_ that serves as the root source of on-disk information about the volume and its file system.  These are _virtual objects_ whose references are managed by the [Container’s _Object Map_](/post/2022/12/12/APFS-OMAP).  Once you understand how to parse an Object Map, identifying the on-disk location of these superblocks is simple.

1. Read the `nx_max_file_systems` field of the [_NX Superblock Object_](/post/2022/12/06/APFS-NX-Superblock) to determine the maximum number of volumes that the container can support.

2. Enumerate the `nx_fs_oid` array looking for the non-zero _virtual object identifiers_ of each Volume Superblock Object. The identifiers may not always be stored contiguously in the array, but all array entries after `nx_max_file_systems` will always be zero.

3. Query the Container's Object Map to locate the physical address of each Volume Superblock. 

## On-Disk Structures

Volume Superblock Objects are stored on disk as `apfs_superblock_t` structures.  We will discuss many of these structure fields in detail throughout this series.  Below is a short description of each.

#### Optional Feature Flags

_Optional Feature Flags_ indicate that the volume uses newer features that older APFS implementations may not support but should be backward compatible with older standards. Implementations that do not support these features should still be able to mount the volume read/write without problems. These bit-flags are stored in the `apfs_features` field of the Volume Superblock.

{: style="margin-left: 0"}
Name | Value | Description
---- | ----- | -----------
APFS_FEATURE_DEFRAG_PRERELEASE | 0x00000001 | _reserved_
APFS_FEATURE_HARDLINK_MAP_RECORDS | 0x00000002 | The volume has hardlink map records
APFS_FEATURE_DEFRAG | 0x00000004 | The volume supports defragmentation
APFS_FEATURE_STRICTATIME | 0x00000008 | This volume updates file access times every time the file is read
APFS_FEATURE_VOLGRP_SYSTEM_INO_SPACE | 0x00000010 | This volume supports mounting a system and data volume as a single user-visible volume

#### Incompatible Volume Feature Flags

_Incompatible Volume Feature Flags_ indicate that the volume uses newer features that may not be supported by older APFS implementations and are not fully backward compatible with older standards. Implementations not supporting these features will likely have problems mounting the volume and are encouraged not to do so. These bit-flags are stored in the `apfs_incompatible_features` field of the Volume Superblock.

{: style="margin-left: 0"}
Name | Value | Description
---- | ----- | -----------
APFS_INCOMPAT_CASE_INSENSITIVE | 0x00000001 | Filenames on this volume are case insensitive
APFS_INCOMPAT_DATALESS_SNAPS | 0x00000002 | At least one snapshot with no data exists for this volume
APFS_INCOMPAT_ENC_ROLLED | 0x00000004 | This volumeʼs encryption has changed keys at least once
APFS_INCOMPAT_NORMALIZATION_INSENSITIVE | 0x00000008 | Filenames on this volume are normalization insensitive
APFS_INCOMPAT_INCOMPLETE_RESTORE | 0x00000010 | This volume is being restored, or a restore operation to this volume was uncleanly aborted
APFS_INCOMPAT_SEALED_VOLUME | 0x00000020 | This volume can't be modified
APFS_INCOMPAT_RESERVED_40 | 0x00000040 | _reserved_

#### Volume Flags

_Volume Flags_ are used to indicate additional information about the volume's status. This bit-field is stored in the `apfs_flags` field of the Volume Superblock.

{: style="margin-left: 0"}
Name | Value | Description
---- | ----- | -----------
APFS_FS_UNENCRYPTED | 0x00000001 | The volume is not encrypted
APFS_FS_RESERVED_2 | 0x00000002 | _reserved_
APFS_FS_RESERVED_4 | 0x00000004 | _reserved_
APFS_FS_ONEKEY | 0x00000008 | Files on the volume are all encrypted using the volume encryption key (VEK)
APFS_FS_SPILLEDOVER | 0x00000010 | The volume has run out of allocated space on the solid-state drive
APFS_FS_RUN_SPILLOVER_CLEANER | 0x00000020 | The volume has spilled over and the spillover cleaner must be run
APFS_FS_ALWAYS_CHECK_EXTENTREF | 0x00000040 | The volume's extent reference tree is always consulted when deciding whether to overwrite an extent
APFS_FS_RESERVED_80 | 0x00000080 | _reserved_
APFS_FS_RESERVED_100 | 0x00000100 | _reserved_

#### Volume Roles

In most instances, an APFS Volume is marked as having a defined _role_. The presence of these roles is context specific, depending on whether the device being analyzed is running macOS or iOS. A Volume can only have a single defined role whose value is stored in the `apfs_role` member of the Volume Superblock.

{: style="margin-left: 0"}
Name | Value | Description
---- | ----- | -----------
APFS_VOL_ROLE_NONE | 0x0000 | The volume has no defined role
APFS_VOL_ROLE_SYSTEM | 0x0001 | The volume contains a root directory for the system
APFS_VOL_ROLE_USER | 0x0002 | The volume contains users' home directories
APFS_VOL_ROLE_RECOVERY | 0x0004 | The volume contains a recovery system
APFS_VOL_ROLE_VM | 0x0008 | The volume is used as swap space for virtual memory
APFS_VOL_ROLE_PREBOOT | 0x0010 | The volume contains files needed to boot from an encrypted volume
APFS_VOL_ROLE_INSTALLER | 0x0020 | The volume is used by the OS installer
APFS_VOL_ROLE_DATA | 0x0040 | The volume contains mutable data

APFS_VOL_ROLE_ENTERPRISE | 0x0240 | This volume is used to store enterprise-managed data
APFS_VOL_ROLE_RESERVED_10 | 0x0280 | _reserved_
APFS_VOL_ROLE_PRELOGIN | 0x02C0 | This volume is used to store system data used before login

#### apfs_modified_by_t

Volume Superblocks store record-keeping information about the tool used to create them in the `apfs_formatted_by` field.  In this case, the id field of the `apfs_modified_by_t` structure will give the name and version number of the userland program used to create the volume.

These `apfs_modified_by_t` structures are also used to keep a history of the `apfs.kext` versions used for the last eight times the volume was mounted read/write.  These are stored in the `apfs_modified_by` array field.


```cpp
#define APFS_MODIFIED_NAMELEN 32

// Information about a program that modified the volume.
typedef struct apfs_modified_by {
    uint8_t id[APFS_MODIFIED_NAMELEN]; // 0x00
    uint64_t timestamp;                // 0x20
    xid_t last_xid;                    // 0x28
} apfs_modified_by_t;                  // 0x30
```

- `id`: A string that identifies the program and its version
- `timestamp`: The time that the program last modified this volume
- `last_xid`: The time that the program last modified this volume

# Conclusion

Locating and analyzing Volume Superblocks are essential early steps in being able to parse the contents of their file systems.  Our next post will discuss the volume’s File System Tree, a specialized B-Tree that stores the bulk of the file systems’ metadata objects.

title: 2022 APFS Advent Challenge Day 14 - Sealed Volumes
---

With the release of macOS 11, Apple added a security feature to APFS called _sealed volumes_.  Sealed volumes can be used to cryptographically verify the contents of the read-only _system_ volume as an additional layer of protection against rootkits and other malware that may attempt to replace critical components of the operating system.  Sealed volumes have subtle differences from some of the properties of file systems that we've discussed so far.

## Identifying a Sealed Volume

Sealed volumes can be identified by checking for the `APFS_INCOMPAT_SEALED_VOLUME` flag in the `apfs_incompatible_features` field of their [_Volume Superblock_](/post/2022/12/13/APFS-Volume-Superblock).  In addition, the `apfs_integrity_meta_oid` and `apfs_fext_tree_oid` fields must have non-zero values.

An _Integrity Metadata Object_ stores information about the sealed volume.  This is a virtual object that is owned by the volume's [_Object Map_](/post/2022/12/12/APFS-OMAP) and whose _object identifier_ can be found in the `apfs_integrity_meta_oid` field of the Volume Superblock.  On disk, it is stored as an `integrity_meta_phys_t` structure.

```cpp
typedef struct integrity_meta_phys {
    obj_phys_t im_o;               // 0x00
    uint32_t im_version;           // 0x20
    uint32_t im_flags;             // 0x24
    apfs_hash_type_t im_hash_type; // 0x28
    uint32_t im_root_hash_offset;  // 0x2C
    xid_t im_broken_xid;           // 0x30
    uint64_t im_reserved[9];       // 0x38
} integrity_meta_phys_t;           // 0x80
```
- `im_o`: The object's header
- `im_version`: The version of the data structure
- `im_flags`: The configuration flags
- `im_hash_type`: The hash algorithm that is used
- `im_root_hash_offset`: The offset (in bytes) of the root hash relative to the start of the object
- `im_broken_xid`: The identifier of the transaction that unsealed the volume
- `im_reserved`: _reserved_ (_only in version 2 or above_)

#### Integrity Metadata Flags

{: style="margin-left: 0"}
Name | Value | Description
-----|-------|------------
APFS_SEAL_BROKEN | 0x00000001 | The volume was modified after being sealed, breaking its seal

#### Hash Types

{: style="margin-left: 0"}
Name | Value | Description
-----|-------|------------
APFS_HASH_INVALID | 0 | An invalid hash algorithm
APFS_HASH_SHA256 | 0x1 |  The SHA-256 variant of Secure Hash Algorithm 2
APFS_HASH_SHA512_256 | 0x2 | The SHA-512/256 variant of Secure Hash Algorithm 2
APFS_HASH_SHA384 | 0x3 | The SHA-384 variant of Secure Hash Algorithm 2
APFS_HASH_SHA512 | 0x4 | The SHA-512 variant of Secure Hash Algorithm 2

## File System Tree

_Sealed Volumes_ can ensure integrity by hashing the contents of their [_File System Trees_](/post/2022/12/15/APFS-FSTrees).  This hashing necessitates some slight differences to the B-Tree. These modified B-Trees can be identified by the `BTREE_HASHED` and `BTREE_NOHEADER` flags being set in their [_B-Tree Info_](/post/2022/12/08/APFS-BTrees).

In standard B-Trees, _non-leaf nodes_ store the object identifier of their children in the value-half of their entries.  "Hashed" B-Trees instead use `btn_index_node_val_t` structures for this purpose, which store the cryptographic hash of the child node's contents along with its identifier.  Hashed nodes are also stored as _headerless_ objects, with their 32-byte header being zeroed out.

```cpp
#define BTREE_NODE_HASH_SIZE_MAX 64

typedef struct btn_index_node_val {
    oid_t binv_child_oid;                              // 0x00
    uint8_t binv_child_hash[BTREE_NODE_HASH_SIZE_MAX]; // 0x08
} btn_index_node_val_t;                                // 0x48
```
- `binv_child_oid`: The _object identifier_ of the child node
- `binv_child_hash`: The hash of the child node

## Data Stream Extents

As we discussed yesterday, [_Data Streams_](/post/2022/12/19/APFS-Data-Streams) store their extents as _file system records_ in the File System Tree.  Sealed Volumes store extents in a separate _File Extent Tree_, whose _virtual object identifier_ is stored in the `apfs_fext_tree_oid` of the Volume Superblock.

The key-half of the File Extent Tree entries are `fext_tree_key_t` structures and are sorted first by `private_id` and then by `logical_addr`.

```cpp
typedef struct fext_tree_key {
    uint64_t private_id;   // 0x00
    uint64_t logical_addr; // 0x08
} fext_tree_key_t;         // 0x10
```
- `private_id`: The object identifier of the file
- `logical_addr`: The offset (in bytes) within the file's data for the data stored in this extent

The value-half takes the form of a `fext_tree_val_t` structure.  Its fields are interpreted in the same way as the `j_file_extent_val` fields.  There is no `crypto_id` because sealed system volumes are never encrypted.

```cpp
typedef struct fext_tree_val {
    uint64_t len_and_flags;  // 0x00
    uint64_t phys_block_num; // 0x08
} fext_tree_val_t;           // 0x10
```
- `len_and_flags`: A bit field that contains the length of the extent and its flags
- `phys_block_num`: The starting physical block address of the extent

## Conclusion

Sealed Volumes in APFS provide an extra layer of security by allowing macOS to verify its system volume cryptographically. This post described some of the subtle differences in analyzing sealed volumes.

title: 2022 APFS Advent Challenge Day 22 - Retrospective
---

As 2022 ends, so does my APFS Advent Challenge. Deciding at the last minute to write this series of blogs turned out to be even more challenging than expected. Life tends to find a way to complicate things, and December was no exception for me this year. I am glad I stuck with the challenge and hope that the information provided in the series was of some value to you.

### Donations

To help keep me honest and support a worthy cause, I pledged to donate $100 to the [Ukraine Humanitarian Fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/ukraine-humanitarian-fund) for each day I failed to write a post.

Early on, I decided to challenge's parameters from posting every day until Christmas to posting every weekday in December. Because that changed the maximum number of posts from 24 to 22, I donated [$200 on December 3rd](/images/advent2022/donate1.png).

I donated an additional $100 per day on days [10](/images/advent2022/donate2.png) and [19](/images/advent2022/donate3.png) when my recently diagnosed carpel tunnel syndrome symptoms were especially bothersome.

Because I like round numbers, support the cause, and I'm not sure if today's post counts, I have [donated an additional $100](/images/advent2022/donate4.png), bringing my total contribution to the fund to $500 for this challenge.  

If it is within your means, please donate to help the Ukrainian people.  Regardless of your politics, the civilians that have lost everything due to this senseless conflict are blameless and deserving of our support.

### What happens next?

I decided to start this blog as part of my resolution to write more in 2023 and share my research. The advent challenge was a good way of kick-starting that effort. I plan on continuing to post, albeit at a much less demanding pace. If there are any topics about APFS or anything else in the realm of digital forensics that you are interested in learning more about, please feel free to reach out to me. I've decided to sunset my Twitter account, but you'll find me active on Mastodon [@jtsylve@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@jtsylve).

title: 2022 APFS Advent Challenge Day 4 - NX Superblock Objects
---

The _NX Superblock Object_ is a crucial component of APFS. It stores key information about the Container, such as the block size, total number of blocks, supported features, and the object IDs of various trees and other structures used to track and maintain other objects. The on-disk `nx_superblock_t` structure is used as the root source of information to locate all other objects in the checkpoint.  In this post, we will go into detail about this structure as well as discuss methodology that can be used to locate them on-disk.

## On-Disk Structures

- `pr_start_addr`: The physical address of the first block in the range.
- `pr_block_count`: The number of blocks in the range

### nx_superblock_t

`nx_superblock_t` structures store key information about the Container and act as the root source of information to locate all other objects in the checkpoint.  We'll go in detail of most of these as needed, but below is a brief description of each.

## Locating the NX Superblock

Block 0 of the disk partition always contains a copy of the container's `nx_superblock_t` object, but it is not guaranteed to be the most up-to-date version, depending on whether the container was last unmounted _cleanly_. Rather than relying on a possibly invalid superblock object, we can use the information in this block-zero copy to locate the latest, valid checkpoint.

### Step 1: Validating Block Zero

First, it is necessary to determine whether in fact we are dealing with an APFS container in the first place, and (if so) to identify the container's fixed block size.

1. Start by reading at least 4 KiB of data from the start of the partition.  On an APFS formatted partition, this should always be a valid `nx_superblock_t` structure.

2. Validate the object type in the `nx_o.o_type` field and that the `nx_magic` field is set to the `NX_MAGIC` value.

3. Read the container's block size from the `nx_block_size` field.  If it is larger than 4 KiB, re-read the block-zero superblock into memory with the correct block size.

4. [Calculate the object's checksum](/post/2022/12/01/Anatomy-of-an-APFS-Object) and validate it against the value in its object header.

If all goes well, we're in business.

### Step 2: Locate the Checkpoint Descriptor Area

NX Superblock objects are stored in the container's _Checkpoint Descriptor Area_.  In order to locate these superblocks, we must first identify and scan the descriptor area blocks, looking for valid NX Superblock objects.  In some cases, the blocks of the descriptor area are all physically contiguous on disk, which means we only have a single range of blocks to scan.  In other cases, we may need to locate multiple non-contiguous ranges of blocks and scan them in order.

Read the `nx_xp_desc_base` field of the block-zero superblock.  The _most-significant bit_ (MSB) of this value is a flag, and the remaining 63 _least-significant bits_ (LSBs) contain a physical block address.

If the MSB is unset, the descriptor area consists of only a single range of contiguous blocks. The rest of `nx_xp_desc_base` contains the block number of the starting block, and the `nx_xp_desc_blocks` field contains the number of blocks in the area.

Things are a bit more complicated if the MSB is set.  The descriptor area is stored non-contiguously and we'll need to scan multiple ranges.  Rather than the starting block, the LSBs of `nx_xp_desc_base` encode the physical address of a _B-Tree Root Node_ object.  

_We will discuss B-Trees, and how to parse them later this week, but for now it is only necessary to understand that B-Trees in APFS are essentially just ordered key/value stores._  

This particular B-Tree maps `uint64_t` logical starting offsets inside the checkpoint descriptor area to `prange_t` physical block ranges.  Enumerating through the entries in this B-Tree allows us to identify the order and location of each ranges of blocks in the checkpoint descriptor area.

### Step 3: Search the Checkpoint Descriptor Area

As discussed in our [last post](/post/2022/12/05/APFS-Containers), the container's _Checkpoint Descriptor Area_ stores two types of objects: _NX Superblocks_ and _Checkpoint Maps_.  These objects can be differentiated by the `o_type` member of their object headers.

Search each range of blocks in the descriptor area, looking for NX Superblock objects.  There should be more than one, which each superblock representing a specific checkpoint.  Validate each superblock as before, and keep track of the _valid_ superblock with the highest _transaction identifier_ (`xid`).  Since NX Superblock objects are the last objects flushed to disk during a checkpoint transaction, this _should_ mean you've located the information needed to parse the most up-to-date state of the container.  If you run into problems parsing information from a container later down the road, you can always try starting from the NX Superblock with the next-highest `xid`.

## Conclusion

Understanding how to interpret and locate _NX Superblock Objects_ is the first step in parsing APFS.  These objects are essential to the process of locating all other objects in a checkpoint.  In our next post, we will discuss _Checkpoint Maps_, and how they can be used to locate ephemeral objects on disk.

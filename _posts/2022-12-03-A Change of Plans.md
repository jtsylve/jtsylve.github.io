It turns out that this advent challenge is much more challenging than anticipated!  The pressures of having to prepare a post per day without having written them ahead of time are proving to be a detriment to my work-life balance (especially since the semester hasn't yet ended and so I'm still teaching night classes after work).  

To ensure content quality, and for the sake of my own mental health, I've decided to modify the terms of the challenge.  Rather than releasing a post every day between the 1st and 24th of December, I will only release posts on Monday-Friday, but I will extend the challenge until the end of December.

This new schedule guarantees that there will be at least two fewer posts than originally promised, so I have donated $200 to the [Ukraine Humanitarian Fund](https://www.gofundme.com/f/ukraine-humanitarian-fund) as promised.  Check back on Monday, when we'll be discussing APFS Containers.

<p>
      Every day between December 1st and 24th of this year, I will attempt to post a blog about APFS internals.  For each day that I miss a post, I will donate $100 to support humanitarian aid for Ukrainian citizens.  If you find value in this series, and would like to support this effort, please consider <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/ukraine-humanitarian-fund">donating to the GoFundMe</a>. 
      Slava Ukraini! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
